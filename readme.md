# Eurovision Bias Contest

All code and data used for doing some data science on the past rankings to determine biases for each participating country.

## The idea

-   Collect data about previous rankings for at least the last 20 years (2002-2022)
-   Do some random analysis on the data to get an idea of the present biases in voting
-   Compare results to what other people got
